# Instacard_word2vec

A simple demonstration of using Word2vec model for basked analysis with the [Gensim package](https://pypi.org/project/gensim/)

Training data is from on the Instacard 2017 shopping dataset https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017.

The dataset is no longer available from Instacard, so try to find it through this article: https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2.

Importing the `vect.tsv` and `meta.tsf` into the [Tensorflow projector](http://projector.tensorflow.org/) will give a 3D visualization like this:
